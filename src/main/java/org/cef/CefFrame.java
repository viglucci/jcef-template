 * This is a simple example application using JCEF.
 * It displays a JFrame with a JTextField at its top and a CefBrowser in its 
 * center. The JTextField is used to enter and assign an URL to the browser UI.
 * No additional handlers or callbacks are used in this example.
 *
 * The number of used JCEF classes is reduced (nearly) to its minimum and should
 * assist you to get familiar with JCEF.
 *
 * For a more feature complete example have also a look onto the example code
 * within the package "tests.detailed".

		//     "getInstance()" instead of a CTOR.
		//
		//     CefApp is responsible for the global CEF context. It loads all
		//     required native libraries, initializes CEF accordingly, starts a
		//     background task to handle CEF's message loop and takes care of
		//     shutting down CEF after disposing it.

		// (2) JCEF can handle one to many browser instances simultaneous. These
		//     browser instances are logically grouped together by an instance of
		//     the class CefClient. In your application you can create one to many
		//     instances of CefClient with one to many CefBrowser instances per
		//     client. To get an instance of CefClient you have to use the method
		//     "createClient()" of your CefApp instance. Calling an CTOR of
		//     CefClient is not supported.
		//
		//     CefClient is a connector to all possible events which come from the
		//     CefBrowser instances. Those events could be simple things like the
		//     change of the browser title or more complex ones like context menu
		//     events. By assigning handlers to CefClient you can control the
		//     behavior of the browser. See tests.detailed.MainFrame for an example
		//     of how to use these handlers.

		//     rendered or windowed rendered. To get an instance of CefBrowser you
		//     have to call the method "createBrowser()" of your CefClient
		//     instances.
		//
		//     CefBrowser has methods like "goBack()", "goForward()", "loadURL()",
		//     and many more which are used to control the behavior of the displayed
		//     content. The UI is held within a UI-Compontent which can be accessed
		//     by calling the method "getUIComponent()" on the instance of CefBrowser.
		//     The UI component is inherited from a java.awt.Component and therefore
		//     it can be embedded into any AWT UI.

		pack();
 
		// (6) To take care of shutting down CEF accordingly, it's important to call
		//     the method "dispose()" of the CefApp instance if the Java
		//     application will be closed. Otherwise you'll get asserts from CEF.
